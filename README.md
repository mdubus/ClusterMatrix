# ClusterMatrix

An electronic-project made by 3 42-students for the 42-students. 

This project took us 6 months from the specifications to the final product. 

Its aim is to allow students to find easily free places to work alone or in small groups in the Clusters.

The project is now at the entrance of the school and use by the students daily.
